From his days as a student leader during the fight against dictatorship, to his historic independent Senate run, to his 2022 vice-presidential campaign with Leni Robredo, he has often found himself “behind the eight ball”—facing steep odds and awesome obstacles. Yet he has consistently chosen integrity over compromise, the difficult NO rather than the easy YES, proving that living honestly and simply, and standing with farmers, fisherfolk, and ordinary citizens is the surest path to good governance and meaningful change.

She obtained her PhD at Louisiana State University, USA and her BS Agriculture major in Soil Science in 2009 and MS Soil Science minor in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology in 2013, from the University of the Philippines, Los Baños (UPLB). \n\nDr. Cruz advanced research studies on using plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) in boosting rice yield and reducing production cost of rice particularly the potential Streptomyces mutabilis, Pseudomonas sp., and several nitrogen-fixers as microbial inoculants. She also isolated several PGPB from different crops such as nipa, rice, corn, sugarcane and wheat. Additionally, she focused on exploring the utilization of beneficial microorganisms like silicate-solubilizing bacteria (SSB) in rice production. The fluorescent microscopy analysis to evaluate the survival of GFP-tagged SSB isolate, revealed the ability of SSB isolate to colonize root tissues of rice seedlings. Understanding the colonization potential of SSB and its survival is important in making inoculant formulation and is fundamental for bio-based seed treatment technology. Lastly, she is currently conducting soil microbial diversity in some rice productions areas at Philippine Rice Research Institute. This will serve as good indicator of soil fertility and soil health status of the area. \n\nHer research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the role and importance of PGPR in sustainable rice production. PGPR can enhance rice growth through a wide variety of mechanisms. Bacterial inoculation of PGPR can contribute to increase agronomic efficiency by reducing production costs and environmental pollution. At the macro level, her research results may prove pivotal in breaking the low yield barrier in rice areas while lessening chemical fertilizer use hence, offering the industry a practical, innovative, and ecologically-smart crop care solution, not to mention its huge potential as a commercial product.",
